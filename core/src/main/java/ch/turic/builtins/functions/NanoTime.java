=== `nano_time`

The `nano_time` function in Turicum returns the current value of the most precise available system timer, expressed in nanoseconds.
It is a direct wrapper around Javaâ€™s `+System.nanoTime()+` method.
It is typically used for measuring elapsed time with high resolution.

Unlike timestamps, the returned value has no absolute meaning but is strictly monotonic, making it ideal for performance profiling and timing operations.

 * This function returns the system nano time. It can be used to measure the time passed, and is not suitable for
