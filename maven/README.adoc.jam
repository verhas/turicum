This module lets you maintain your `pom` structure files using the Turicum language.
The Turicum language format is more flexible than XML, and it is a kind of programmable JSON.
At the same time, the extension not only creates the Project Object Model (POM)  in memory but also saves it to the `pom.xml` file.
This gives you the advantage that you can use tools that rely on the XML-formatted POM.
Having the latest POM in xml also means you can abandon the extension any time, you are not locked-in.

[WARNING]
====
This project is a Maven extension.
Maven extensions run before Maven, and they are not the same thing as Maven plugins.
There is no Turicum Maven plugin.

This extension, Turicum version 1.4.1 and later was tested with Maven `3.9.11` and `4.0.0-rc-4`
====

Create a `.mvn` in your project root to use this module.
This directory will contain the file `extensions.xml` with the content:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<extensions>
    <extension>
        <groupId>ch.turicch.turic</groupId>
        <artifactId>{%ARTIFACT_ID%}</artifactId>
        <version>{%VERSION%}</version>
    </extension>
</extensions>
----

When you start Maven, it will read the `pom.turi` file, convert it using Turicum, and create the `pom.xml` file.

[NOTE]
====
The actual process is the following.
When a user invokes Maven, it looks at the `.mvn/extensions.xml` file, and it sees that the Turicum Maven Extension is configured there.
It loads the Turicum Maven Extension and invokes it to locate the POM file.
This call assumes that a POM file is already present, and at this point, the extension is supposed to locate it.

The Turicum Maven Extension cheats a bit.
First, it reads the Turicum source files, and it creates the `pom.xml` file.
The processing includes program execution and formatting the final XML result.
Once this step is completed, the extension writes the `pom.xml` file and returns a Java `File` object referencing the file.

Maven later requests the extension to load the project object model from this file.
The extension knows at this point that the generated `pom.xml` file is already a standard XML-formatted pom,
and it simply asks the standard Maven Platform Reader to read it.
When the Maven Platform Reader returns with the object model, the extension passes it back to Maven, and the rest is standard Maven business as usual.

NOTE: This way you can have the `pom.xml` file and the implementation of the extension was also simpler.

== Using the Generated `pom.xml`

The created `pom.xml` is saved to the directory and not removed after it has been processed.
It is also available for the IDE, which may not be able to read the Turicum POM file.
You can add it to your source control if you wish.

IntelliJ recognizes and handles Maven extensions.

== Converting Your Project to Use `pom.turi`

When you want to convert a project to use the Turicum maven extension, you only have to

. create the `.mvn/extensions.xml` file

. convert the existing `pom.xml` files to `pom.turi`.

The `pom.turi` file should contain a Turicum program that results in a formatted XML.
In Turicum, every command has a value, and the value of the program is the value of the last executed command.
You are free to create the XML string in any way, but there is a Turicum library you can import that makes it easy.

    sys_import "turi.maven"

This file defines and exports a class called `maven_project`.
You create an instance of this class

  let project = maven_project({
    name : "maven extension",
    artifactId : "turicum-maven-extension"
    version : VERSION,
    ...

passing a JSON structure (or any classless Turicum object).

For a simpler project, you can just use a JSON literal.
When the structure is more complex, you can build the object in several steps.
Turicum offers numerous language constructs to create a flexible POM build-up.

At the end of the `pom.turi`, you can call

    project.done()

It will convert the `project` structure to an XML string and return it formatted.
This XML will be saved by the extension into the `pom.xml` and used to define the project structure.

=== Attributes and Singular Tags

This section is about how to handle XML attributes that are only needed in POM files in exceptional cases.
Some plugin configuration uses attributes.
If you do not need it, you can skip this section.

==== Attributes

XML tags can have attributes.
JSON does not have such a feature.

On the other hand, JSON names can start with the `@` character.
XML tags cannot.

Every JSON field in the Turicum project object starting with a `@` character will be converted to an attribute.
The following example shows how an object is converted to XML using this feature:

{%S to_xml%}

[NOTE]
====
The example above does not use the Maven Turicum library and is not producing a `pom.xml`.
It is an example of XML handling.

`pom.xml` files rarely use XML attributes.
This feature of the XML conversion provided by the Turicum library is for general use.
====

==== Lists, Singular Tags

Another difference between XML and JSON is that XML does not have lists.
In a POM file, you usually have a tag, which is the plural form of a noun, and then the subtags are the singular version.

The converter automatically detects this.
When you have a list and the name ends with `ies` or `s`.
`dependencies`, for example, will be paired with `dependency` automatically.

{%S plural1%}

In some rare cases, this may not work.
In that case, you can define a field named "!" (a single character, exclamation mark) in the first element of the list to specify the name of the singular tag.

{%S plural2%}

== Getting Rid of the Extension

.TLDR;
[NOTE]
====
Remove the `.mvn` directory and the Turicum source files, while keeping the generated `pom.xml` files.
However, just don't do it!
It is a fantastic tool.
====

It may happen that, for some reason, you want to remove the extension.
The reasons can be various.
The maintenance of the project is passed on to a team that is not knowledgeable about Turicum.
A new corporate policy may exclude external tools or restrict the extensions and plugins you can use with Maven.
You may run into some unforeseen complexity problems using Turicum, and you may not have time to debug your Turicum code.
It is straightforward to revert the operation to standard Maven compilation temporarily or finally in any of those cases.

This extension retains the XML format as opposed to other Maven extensions.
You do not need any conversion step from DSL to XML; the `pom.xml` is always there.
What you have to do to revert the operation to standard Maven and `pom.xml` based compilation is to remove the `.mvn` directory.

If reverting to standard `pom.xml` based compilation is final, then do not forget to remove the `.mvn` directory from the source control.
